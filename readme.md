# Sample for Angular 2 AOT Compilation with webpack, AOT-Plugin and Lazy Loading

# Build

To build the sample with webpack and AOT just run

```
npm run webpack
```

# Start

```
npm start
```

Please note, that this starts live-server, as webpack-dev-server has currently problems with AOT (October 2010).
